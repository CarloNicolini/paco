# PACO "Partitioning Cost Optimization"
# Source Release 0.10 Alpha December, 12, 2016

PACO is a tool to build solvers and optimize quality functions on graphs for community detection.
PACO comes as both a C++ library and a support for Matlab/Octave mex function as well as a Python library.

## Requirements
In order to compile PACO you need:
COMPULSORY:
1. The `C` libraries of `igraph` at least `0.7.1`
2. A C/C++ compiler (tested on `g++ <=5.5` and `clang <= 800-0.38`), not tested under any Windows compiler.
3. CMake to generate the Makefiles or projects.

OPTIONAL
3. MATLAB with mex compiler
4. Octave with all headers files installed (package `octave-dev` in Ubuntu)
5. Python with Cython extensions (tested on Cython >=0.20)

## Compilation of simple command line paco_optimizer
In order to compile the `paco_optimizer`  command line executable you must do:

    $> git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/carlonicolini/paco
    $> cd paco
    $> mkdir build
    $> cmake ..
    $> make

and you will start the compilation. Otherwise if you have the tar.gz with the last release:

    $> tar -zxvf paco_0_10_alpha.tar.gz
    $> cd paco_0_10_alpha
    $> mkdir build
    $> cd build
    $> cmake ..
    $> make

PACO supports some options for the compile-time that enable the generation of Matlab and Octave wrappers.
To enable them, specify the option `-DMATLAB_SUPPORT` or `-DOCTAVE_SUPPORT` when you run `cmake`:

### Compilation of MATLAB mex file
In order to compile the `paco_mx`  mex function you must do:

    $> tar -zxvf paco_0_10_alpha.tar.gz
    $> cd paco_0_10_alpha
    $> mkdir build
    $> cd build
    $> cmake -DMATLAB_SUPPORT=True ..
    $> make


### Compilation of OCTAVE mex file
In order to compile the `paco_oct`  mex function you must do:

    $> tar -zxvf paco_0_10_alpha.tar.gz
    $> cd paco_0_10_alpha
    $> mkdir build
    $> cd build
    $> cmake -DOCTAVE_SUPPORT=True ..
    $> make

### Compilation of PYTHON module
In order to compile the `pypaco` python module you must do:

    $> tar -zxvf paco_0_10_alpha.tar.gz
    $> cd paco_0_10_alpha
    $> mkdir build
    $> cd build
    $> cmake -DPYTHON_SUPPORT=True ..
    $> make

## Specify the igraph libraries
PACO depends heavily on igraph-0.7.1. If you didn't install the igraph 0.7.1 libraries in the standard location (for example you don't have administrative privileges for your computer), you need to specify them at Cmake time with the options

    -DCMAKE_EXTRA_LIBRARIES="PATH_TO_YOUR_IGRAPH_DIRECTORY_WHERE_LIBS_ARE_STORED"
    -DCMAKE_EXTRA_INCLUDE="PATH_TO_YOUR_IGRAPH_DIRECTORY_WHERE_INCLUDE_ARE_STORED"

For example the files `libigraph.a  libigraph.la  libigraph.so  libigraph.so.0  libigraph.so.0.0.0` are stored in `$HOME/lib` and the headers files `igraph***.h` are stored in `$HOME/include/igraph`. In this cased you need to specify CMake where these two folders are in this way:

    $> cmake -DCMAKE_EXTRA_LIBRARIES=$HOME/lib/ -DCMAKE_EXTRA_INCLUDES=$HOME/include ..

and then run make as usual.


# Usage of PACO
## Usage of command line optimizer

Once compiled, you can see the instructions of `paco_optimizer`

    $> ./paco_optimizer 
    Usage: paco_optimizer graph_file [options]
    graph_file the file containing the graph. Accepted formats are pajek, graph_ml, adjacency matrix or
    edges list (the ncol format), additionally with a third column with edge weights
    Options:
    -q [quality]
       0 Binary Surprise
       1 Significance
       2 Asymptotic Surprise
       3 Infomap
    -m [method]:   0 Agglomerative Optimizer
       1 Random
       2 Simulated Annealing
    -V [report_level] ERROR=0, WARNING=1, INFO=2, DEBUG=3, DEBUG1=4, DEBUG2=5, DEBUG3=6, DEBUG4=7
    -S [seed] specify the random seed, default time(0)
    -b [bool] wheter to start with initial random cluster or every node in its community
    -r [repetitions], number of repetitions of PACO, default=1
    -p [print solution]

The supported graph file formats are PAJEK (`.net` extension), GRAPHML (`.gml` extension), full adjacency matrix (text file with the values of adjacency matrix with `.adj` extension), or edges list (text file with edges list as two column file for unweighted or three column file for weighted edges, extension `.ncol`)

## Usage of PACO mex file under MATLAB:

Once compiled, check that the matlab mex file `paco_mx.*` exists in your PACO folder. Start a MATLAB session and issue:

    > addpath('folder_of_paco_mex_file')    
    > paco_mx

This command with no arguments will show you all the PACO options and an example usage.

    >> paco_mx
    PACO PArtitioning Cost Optimization.
    [membership, qual] = paco(W);
    Input:
        W: an undirected weighted network with positive edge weights. Negative edge weights are not seen as edges and therefore discarded. Remember to use real matrices, logical matrices throw error.
    Output:
        membership: the membership vector that represents the community which every vertex belongs to after quality optimization.
        qual: the current quality of the partition.
    Options:
    paco accepts additional arguments to control the optimization process
    [m, qual] = paco(W,'method',val);
        val is one of the following integers: {0,1,2}:
            0: Agglomerative
            1: Random
            2: Annealing (EXPERIMENTAL)
    [m, qual] = paco(W,'quality',val);
        val is one of the following integers: {0,1,2,3}:
            0: Surprise (discrete)
            1: Significance
            2: AsymptoticSurprise
            3: Infomap
    [m, qual] = paco(W,'nrep',val)
        val is the number of repetitions to run over which to choose the best quality value (the lowest for Infomap, the highest for the other methods
    [m, qual] = paco(W,'seed',val)
     val is a specific random seed to the algorithm, in order to have reproducible results.
    Example:
    >> A=rand(100,100); A=(A+A')/2; A=A.*(A>0.5);
         % Run Asymptotical Surprise optimization on A for 1000 repetitions and return the highest Surprise
     partition membership together with the quality value
    >> [memb, qual] = paco(A,'method',2,'nrep',1000);
    Error using paco_mx
    Error at argument: 0: Not enough input arguments.

## Usage of PACO mex file under OCTAVE:

Once compiled, check that the matlab mex file `paco_mx.*` exists in your PACO folder. Start an OCTAVE session and issue:

    > addpath('folder_of_paco_mex_file')    
    > paco_oct

This command with no arguments will show you all the PACO options and an example usage under OCTAVE. The syntax under MATLAB and OCTAVE is the same, only the filenames are different to avoid MATLAB/OCTAVE interpreter confusion.

P.S. Always remember not to compile MATLAB and OCTAVE mex files together, as the `mex.h` header can be misunderstood from the build system and strange problems may appear.

## Usage of PACO as a Python module

Once compiled import PACO as a Python module:

    >> from pypaco import paco

** PACO Usage **

    Usage:
        [membership, quality] = paco(A, **kwargs)
    Args:

            0: Surprise
            1: Significance
            2: Asymptotic Surprise
            3: Infomap
        opt_method: Optimization method
            0: Agglomerative,

** Example: passing graph as adjacency matrix **

    import numpy as np
    from pypaco import paco
    G = nx.karate_club_graph()
    A  = nx.to_numpy_matrix(G)
    [membership,quality] = paco(A, quality=0, nreps=10)

** Example: passing graph as edges list **

    import numpy as np
    from pypaco import paco
    G = nx.karate_club_graph()
    E = np.array(G.edges()).astype(float64) # E must be a numpy array of doubles, not a list
    [membership,quality] = paco(E, quality=0, nreps=10)

** Example: passing graph as weighted edges list **

    import numpy as np
    from pypaco import paco
    G = nx.karate_club_graph()
    E = np.array(G.edges())
    # Generate weights on the edges, in values between 0 and 10-1
    W = np.random.randint(10,size=[G.number_of_edges(),1])
    EW = np.concatenate((E,W),axis=1).astype(float)
    [membership,quality] = paco(EW, quality=2, nreps=10)
    


# Obtaining igraph in Ubuntu 12.04 or greater
We suggest compiling `igraph` from source, since PACO needs `igraph`>=0.7.1.

Go to [www.igraph.org/c](www.igraph.org/c) and follow the documentation for the compilation using the autogen script they provide, otherwise follow the following instructions:

## Compilation and installation of igraph on Ubuntu 12.04 or greater

1. Download igraph-0.7.1 source code:

```
$> cd
$> wget http://igraph.org/nightly/get/c/igraph-0.7.1.tar.gz
```
 
2. Extract the code under your home folder:

```
$> tar -zxvf igraph-0.7.1.tar.gz
```

3. Install the necessary libs, under Ubuntu:

```
$> sudo apt-get install build-essential libxml2-dev zlib1g-dev
```

4. Try to configure and compile igraph:

```
$> cd igraph-0.7.1/
$> ./configure
$> make 
```

5. If you have many processors on your computer, make in parallel mode, instead of `make` just issue `make -j8` for example to compile with 8 cores.

6. Check if installation went fine:

```
$> make check
```

7. If tests are passed, then install it. I usually install *igraph* under `/usr/lib/`. To do that I call `make install` with administrator privileges. 

```
$> sudo make install
```

8. If you don't have administrator privileges you can compile igraph under your home folder.

In the rest of the notes we assume that the Igraph include directory is `/usr/local/include/igraph`.

## Obtaining igraph in OSX
We strongly suggest to obtain `igraph` in OSX using **Homebrew**.

    $> ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
    $> brew tap homebrew/science
    $> brew install igraph

The CMAKE will then find the installed dependencies correctly.

# Windows support:
Despite everything should be ready to be ported in Windows, I don't have time to let the code compile smoothly on Windows and to adapt all the nitty gritty details of compilation of PACO under windows. If you want to join me in extending PACO for Windows please let me know.

# FAQ

## Linking libstdc++.so.6 problem

1. I can compile PACO for MATLAB but after calling `paco_mx`, MATLAB prompts me with the following error message:

```
Invalid MEX-file '~/paco_mx.mexa64': /usr/local/MATLAB/R2015a/bin/glnxa64/../../sys/os/glnxa64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.21' not found (required by ...
```

This problem means that the `libstdc++.so.6` inside the Matlab library folder is pointing to a version of `libstdc++` older than the system one, usually stored in `/usr/lib/x86_64` folder.

To solve the issue you need to redirect the symbolic links in the MATLAB folder to the systemwise `libstdc++`. Hereafter we assume the MATLAB folder to be `/usr/local/MATLAB/R2015a` and the system to be some Linux variant.

Two of the symlinks for libraries need to be changed:

```
$> cd /usr/local/MATLAB/R2015a/sys/os/glnxa64
$> ls -l
```

The sym links for libstdc++.so.6 and libgfortran.so.3 should point to versions in /usr/lib, not local ones.

Before changing this libraries, first make sure `g++-4.4` and `libgfortran3`are installed :

```
$> sudo apt-get install g++-4.4 libgfortran3
```

Now, modify the symlinks:

```
$> sudo ln -fs /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgfortran.so.3.0.0 libgfortran.so.3
$> sudo ln -fs /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.4/libstdc++.so libstdc++.so.6
```

This command makes the `libstdc++.so.6` point to the `g++-4.4` `libstdc++` library.

For other informations take a look at http://dovgalecs.com/blog/matlab-glibcxx_3-4-11-not-found/ or https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/issues/960 which are very similar problems.
